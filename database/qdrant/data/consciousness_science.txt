Neuroscience and cognitive science approach consciousness as an emergent property of brain activity. Scientists study neural correlates, brain regions, and computational models to explain awareness and subjective experience. Artificial intelligence research explores if machines can achieve consciousness. The scientific method relies on empirical evidence, experiments, and measurable phenomena to understand consciousness. 

The scientific investigation of consciousness is a multidisciplinary endeavor, drawing on fields such as neuroscience, psychology, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. Researchers seek to understand how subjective experience arises from the physical processes of the brain, and to identify the neural mechanisms that underlie awareness, perception, and self-reflection. The quest to explain consciousness scientifically has led to a variety of theories, experimental paradigms, and technological innovations.

One of the central goals in the science of consciousness is to identify the neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs)â€”the specific patterns of brain activity that correspond to conscious experience. Using techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and magnetoencephalography (MEG), scientists can observe changes in brain activity as subjects report shifts in awareness. For example, studies have shown that certain regions of the prefrontal cortex and parietal lobes are consistently active during conscious perception, while unconscious processing may involve different neural pathways.
