    "Does the ability of artificial intelligence to simulate decision-making indicate the presence‚Äîor absence‚Äîof free will in machines?",
    "Can moral responsibility exist in a world where every thought and action is caused by prior brain states?",
    "How does quantum indeterminacy (if relevant at the neural level) influence the plausibility of libertarian free will?",
    "Are experiences like qualia (e.g. the redness of red) explainable through neuroscience, or do they require a different explanatory framework?",
    "Does consciousness serve an evolutionary function, or is it a byproduct ('epiphenomenon') of more fundamental cognitive processes?",
    "How do philosophical zombie thought experiments help or hinder our understanding of consciousness?",
    "Is the self a stable, continuous entity, or an illusion constructed by the brain to maintain narrative coherence?"
